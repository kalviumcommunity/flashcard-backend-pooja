server.js (✅ your backend entry file)

package.json (✅ project is initialized)

node_modules (✅ dependencies installed)

1. Create a New Git Branch
Open terminal (inside your backend folder):

git checkout -b post-api-endpoint


Step 1: Go to the correct project folder
In terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd C:\Users\POOJA\S301_Pooja_Capstone_FlashCardStudyApp
✅ This should be the folder that is already linked to your GitHub repo.

🔹 Step 2: Switch to main and pull latest
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout main
git pull origin main
✅ This ensures you’re on the latest clean version of main.

🔹 Step 3: Create a new branch for your POST API
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b new-post-api-endpoint
✅ This branch is now created from main, so GitHub will allow comparisons.

🔹 Step 4: Copy your POST API code to this branch
Now do this manually in File Explorer or VS Code:

Copy the working server.js, index.js, package.json, etc. from your old backend folder (where POST API is working)

Paste those files into this current folder:

makefile
Copy
Edit
C:\Users\POOJA\S301_Pooja_Capstone_FlashCardStudyApp\backend
🔹 Step 5: Add and commit your code
In terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
git add .
git commit -m "Added POST API for flashcards"
🔹 Step 6: Push this new branch to GitHub
bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin new-post-api-endpoint
🔹 Step 7: Create a Pull Request on GitHub
Go to:
https://github.com/kalviumcommunity/S301_Pooja_Capstone_FlashCardStudyApp

Click Pull Requests → New Pull Request

Set:

base = main

compare = new-post-api-endpoint

You will now see your POST API code changes 🎉
